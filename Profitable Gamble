//A program which returns true if we will get the prize money more than we pay in gambling if probability, prize and pay values are given 

//A profitable gamble is a game that yields a positive net profit, where net profit is calculated in the following manner: net_outcome = probability_of_winning * prize - cost_of_playing

//Code

bool profitableGamble(float prob, int prize, float pay) {
	return (prob * prize > pay);
}

//Sample output

profitableGamble(0.2, 50, 9) -> true 

profitableGamble(0.9, 1, 2) -> false 

profitableGamble(0.9, 3, 2) -> true
